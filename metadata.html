<h3 style = "margin-bottom:0px">Population Projection Methodology</h3>
<p style = "font-size: 16px; margin-top:5px">All population projection data is sourced from 
<a href = "http://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/statistics-and-data/statistics/statistics-by-theme/population/population-projections/sub-national-population-projections/2014-based" target = "_blank">National Records of Scotland</a>
The projections used are the 2014-based Scottish Area Principal Projections, published on 27th October 2016. These projections are based on mid-year population estimates, which are then
adjusted year-on-year based on mortality rates, projected migration rates, and fertility rates. Local factors such as student numbers and armed forces are taken into account.
</p>
<p style = "font-size: 16px; margin-top:0px">Population Projections have certain limitations. They are trend based and certain policy decisions are likely to have
 an impact on actual future population levels. This is particularly true for the assumed migration levels. 
 Thus, the projections are estimates of how the existing policy and demographic circumstances and trends are likely
 to lead to future population change. A full description of the limits of these projections can be found <a href="http://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/statistics-and-data/statistics/statistics-by-theme/population/population-projections/uses-and-limitations-of-population-projections">here</a>.

<h3 style = "margin-bottom:0px">Healthy Life Expectancy</h3>
<p style = "font-size: 16px; margin-top:5px">Healthy Life Expectancy (HLE) is an estimate of how many years a person might expect to live in a "healthy" state. 
The figures provided are the most recent HLE figures provided by <a href = "http://www.scotpho.org.uk/population-dynamics/healthy-life-expectancy/key-points", target = "_blank">ScotPHO</a> for 
Scottish Local Authority areas. the figures show HLE at birth for males and females within each local authority, and are based on 5 years of data (2009-13) on deaths and 
population, and a single year of data for self-assessed health from the Scotland Census for 2011.<br>

HLE is a useful indicator to consider how growing elderly populations will translate into increased demand, especially for health and social care services.
As quoted on the ScotPHO website, "It is useful in resource allocation, planning of health and other services, and evaluation of health outcomes."
HLE varies significantly between Local Authorities, reflecting the impact of a number of factors such as deprivation, environment, and housing. This suggests that the way growing elderly populations convert into increased demand on public services
will vary greatly between Local Authorities, and it may be that certain elderly groups are more likely to continue to live 'healthy' lives in certain areas.
Increasing HLE is one of the goals of the Scottish Government set out in <a href = "http://www.gov.scot/About/Performance/scotPerforms/purpose", target = "_blank">Scotland Performs</a>. Although there
has been a general increase in HLE since 1980, and an increase of 2.5 years between 2004 and 2014, there has been relatively <a href="http://www.gov.scot/About/Performance/scotPerforms/purposetargets/population">little change since 2008.</a></p>
<h3 style = "margin-bottom:0px">A Note on Dependency Ratios</h3>
<p style = "font-size: 16px; margin-top:5px">Dependency Ratio is calculated as the ratio of dependents (people aged 15 and under and pensionable age (65 and over))
    to working age people (16-64). This tool uses these age groups to project dependency ratio for all years.
    It is worth noting, however, that the pension age is due to rise to 66 by 2020 and to 67 by 2028. This means that the working age group will be larger than is
    measured in this tool and so dependency ratios will, in practice, be slightly lower than projected here.</p>
