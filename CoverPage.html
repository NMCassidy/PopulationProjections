<h2>Welcome to the <b><em>Population Projector</em></b></h2>
<p style = "font-size: 16px; margin-top:0px">This app uses the small area population projection data from the 
<a href = "http://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/statistics-and-data/statistics/statistics-by-theme/population/population-projections/sub-national-population-projections" target = "_blank">National Records of Scotland</a>
to allow you to easily graph and compare future populations for multiple age groups and the resultant dependency ratio.</p>

<h3><a id="lapPage_link" href="#" class="action-button shiny-bound-input">Local Authority Projections</a></h3>
<p style ="font-size:16px">The data displayed in the app can be selected using the options in the sidebar on the left.<br>
The options are: select an age group from the drop down list; select one or more local authorities
    using the checkbox; select a time series by dragging the sliders; and select whether to view the 
    absolute numerical values or to view the percentage change from the base year using the radio buttons.<br> 
	Once these options are selected the ata will display on the graph on the right with population projection or percentage change on the y-axis and 
	the year on the x-axis. The buttons at the bottom of the sidebar on the left allow you to easily download the graph as an image, 
	or download the selected or full dataset as a csv file.<br>The tabs above the graph allow you to explore some of the data. There are tabs displaying the figures for Over 85 Population,
	dependency ratio, and healthy life expectancy at birth for all Local Authorities
and the <b>Data Explorer</b> tab allows you to view all of the data that has been selected in the sidebar.</p>

<p style = "font-size: 16px; margin-top:0px">The Regional Aggregation Page provides the same functionality as the Local Authority Projections page, 
however rather than provide individual projections it offers an aggregated projection based on all of the selected Local Authorities.</p>
