<h2>Welcome to the <b><em>Population Projector</em></b></h2>
<p style = "font-size: 16px; margin-top:0px">This app uses the small area population projection data from the 
<a href = "http://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/statistics-and-data/statistics/statistics-by-theme/population/population-projections/sub-national-population-projections" target = "_blank">National Records of Scotland</a>
to allow you to easily graph and compare future populations for multiple age groups and the resultant dependency ratio.</p>

<h3><a id="lapPage_link" href="#" class="action-button shiny-bound-input">Local Authority Projections</a></h3>
<p style ="font-size:16px">The data that is displayed in the app is controlled using the options in the sidebar on the left.<br>
The options are: select an age group from the drop down list; select one or more local authorities
    using the checkbox; select a time series by dragging the sliders; and select whether to view the 
    absolute numerical values or to view the percentage change from the base year using the radio buttons.<br> 
	Once these options are selected the ata will display on the graph on the right with population projection or percentage change on the y-axis and 
	the year on the x-axis. The buttons at the bottom of the sidebar on the left allow you to easily download the graph as an image, 
	or download the selected or full dataset as a csv file.<br>The tabs above the graph allow you to explore some of the data. There are tabs displaying the figures for Over 85 Population,
	dependency ratio, and healthy life expectancy at birth for all Local Authorities
and the <b>Data Explorer</b> tab allows you to view all of the data that has been selected in the sidebar.</p>

<h3><a id="regPage_link" href="#" class="action-button shiny-bound-input">Regional Aggregation</a></h3>
<p style = "font-size: 16px; margin-top:0px">The Regional Aggregation Page provides the same functionality as the Local Authority Projections page, 
however rather than provide individual projections it offers an aggregated projection based on all of the selected Local Authorities.</p>

<h4 style = "margin-bottom:0px">Population Projection Methodology</h5>
<p style = "margin-top:0px">All population projection data is sourced from 
<a href = "http://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/statistics-and-data/statistics/statistics-by-theme/population/population-projections/sub-national-population-projections/2014-based" target = "_blank">National Records of Scotland</a>
The projections used are the 2014-based Scottish Area Principal Projections, published on 27th October 2016. These projections are based on mid-year population estimates, which are then
adjusted year-on-year based on mortality rates, projected migration rates, and fertility rates. Local factors such as student numbers and armed forces are taken into account.

<h4 style = "margin-bottom:0px">Healthy Life Expectancy</h5>
<p style = "margin-top:0px">Healthy Life Expectancy (HLE) is an estimate of how many years a person might expect to live in a "healthy" state. 
The figures provided are the most recent HLE figures provided by <a href = "http://www.scotpho.org.uk/population-dynamics/healthy-life-expectancy/key-points", target = "_blank">ScotPHO</a> for 
Scottish Local Authority areas. the figures show HLE at birth for males and females within each local authority, and are based on 5 years of data (2009-13) on deaths and 
population, and a single year of data for self-assessed health from the Scotland Census for 2011.<br>

HLE is a useful indicator to consider how growing elderly populations will translate into increased demand, especially for health and social care services.
As quoted on the ScotPHO website, "It is useful in resource allocation, planning of health and other services, and evaluation of health outcomes."
HLE varies between Local Authorities, reflecting the impact of a number of factors such as deprivation, environment, and housing. This indicates that the way growing elderly populations convert into increased demand on public services
will vary greatly between Local Authorities, and it may be that certain elderly groups are more likely to continue to live 'healthy' lives in certain areas.
Increasing HLE is one of the goals of the Scottish Government set out in <a href = "http://www.gov.scot/About/Performance/scotPerforms/purpose", target = "_blank">Scotland Performs</a>. Although there
has been a general increase in HLE since 1980, and an increase on 2.5 years between 2004 and 2014, there has been relatively <a href="http://www.gov.scot/About/Performance/scotPerforms/purposetargets/population">little change since 2008.</a></p>
<h4 style = "margin-bottom:0px">A Note on Dependency Ratios</h5>
<p style = "margin-top:0px">Dependency Ratio is calculated as the ratio of dependents (people 15 and under and pensionable age (65 and over))
    to working age people (16-64). This tool uses these age groups to project dependency ratio for all years.
    It is worth noting, however, that the pension age is due to rise to 66 by 2020 and to 67 by 2028. This means that the working age group will be larger than is
    measured in this tool and so dependency ratios will, in practice, be slightly lower than projected here.</p>
